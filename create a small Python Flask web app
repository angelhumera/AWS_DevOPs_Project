Go to :Create ec2 instance >> Install docker  >> start docker 
### Docker must be installed and running
cd /home
mkdir flask-docker-app/  
### creates a file, Makes a new directory called flask-docker-app to keep your app files organized
cd flask-docker-app/   
### Move Into That Folder, Enters the newly created project directory.
touch app.py
touch Dockerfile  
### Create Application File and Dockerfile
ls -ltrh     -- List Files  
### ls: list files
### -l: long format, -t: sort by time, -r: reverse order, -h: human readable sizes
### You should see: app.py and Dockerfile as result 
### Add Flask Code to app.py:
vi app.py   
### Press i to insert, and add this simple Flask app given below 

Code : 
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(_name_)
@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello from Flask in Docker!"

if _name_ == "_main_":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)

### Note : Make sure you have space before app.run refer above code 
---------       -------       ---------
Press Esc, then type :wq to save and exit
host="0.0.0.0" → so it works inside Docker container.
port=5000 → Flask default port.
vi Dockerfile  – writing some code to dockerfile
### apply this code given below 

code : 
# Use official Python image
FROM python:3.9-slim
# Set working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app
# Copy the local files to container
COPY . /app
# Install Flask inside container
RUN pip install flask
# Run the Flask app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
--------        ------------- 
esc → :wq -- Save and exit with
now, build a docker image :
docker build -t flask-docker-app .
### -t flask-docker-app: tags the image with name flask-docker-app
###. means: use current directory as build context (where Dockerfile is)

### You should see Docker pulling Python, installing Flask, and building the image.
docker images   
verify image created or not 
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 flask-docker-app
run this 
-d: detached mode (runs in background)
-p 5000:5000: maps port 5000 from container to host
Allocate security group :
Go to sg >> custom tcp >> port range 5000>> anywhere 0.0.0.0/0 save 
Then , copy pub ip address from your instance paste in chrome for results 
You should see: Hello from Flask in Docker!
If it doesn’t load trouble shoot:
Check if port 5000 is allowed in your EC2 security group
Go to sg >> custom tcp >> port range 5000>> anywhere 0.0.0.0/0 save 

Check with docker ps to make sure the container is running
